# Overview

Created for Rutgers University under the course CS213 Software Methodology by Faris A. and Miguel M. This android application allows two users to play the game of chess. The program implements all functionality of the game, and has a few tools during the match, such as automatically doing a move for you, or going back in time one move. You can also save and watch replays as well.
